# Weather_App
A weather app that reports current weather details of any place in the world.

## How to use ?
It's very simple and user-friendly.
1. Select a country from the dropdown menu. If you can't find your country name, try looking for its official name or informal name instead (for example, incase of 'Russian Federation' look for 'Russia' instead).
2. Select a city name from the dropdown menu. Or, you can enter the zipcode instead.
3. Now click the 'Check Weather' button and all the current weather details will be displayed, along with the time at which they were measured.

## Note:
Before using this code, create a python file (.py file) and name it as 'config.py'. Now go to https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up and sign up for a free API key. After that just write one line in your config.py file: "API_KEY = your_api_key". Don't forget to replace 'your_api_key' with your new api key, and ignore the double qoutations. Save this file in the same folder/directory in which you will save the 'Weather_App' code file. Finally, download and extract the city list file in that folder, and you're ready to go !
